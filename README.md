APWMRu0 -- Uses PRU PWM on pin P8_15 with the /boot/firmware/extconf/extlinux.conf set to MotorControl.dts SquareWave0 -- Uses _r30 bit 16 on P8_12 and on GPIO0 62 P8_16 to generate a Square Wave that can be controlled using the /dev/remoteproc/rpmsg_pru30 facility. Refer to comments within source files. SquareWave1 -- Uses _r31 bit 13 on P8_20 and on GPIO0 75 P8_14 to generate a Square Wave that can be controlled using the /dev/remoteproc/rpmsg_pru31 facility. Refer to comments within source files. PruLibrary -- Required for include files and a linked object Debug/src/*.objs
